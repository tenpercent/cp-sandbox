*** Quick start:  Step-by-step instructions with concise comments ***

---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Create libraries
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# vi src/Rules.make 
# vi src/aniAFT/src/cflags.make 
(1) provide correct names for compilers 
(2) define system variable CASROOT pointing to the OpenCascade location 
    Example: export CASROOT=/opt/OpenCASCADE
    For details refer to src/aniAFT/README
    If CASROOT is not defined, the interface with OpenCascade will not
    be installed. 

    You may need to install the following packages libXext-devel, 
    mesa-libGL-devel, mesa-libGLU-devel 

# make libs 
compiles all libraries

# make exe run-ana gmv
defines a trivial mesh in a triangular prism, refines it, and generates a
quasi-uniform mesh in anisotropic metric 

# make run-nod gmv
reads a mesh, defines  a solution, calculates a metric, and generates a mesh
quasi-uniform in this metric

# make run-ref gmv
loads a trivial mesh for a cube, refines it globally 3 times, and then
refines it locally 4 times

# make run-aft gmv
loads a mesh (.out file) generated with library libaft3D and saves it 
using in format (.ani file) understood by other libraries

# make run-fix
improves mesh shape-regularity:  loads a mesh mesh.out (if it does not exist, loads ../data/aft.out),
fixes it and saves back to mesh.out and mesh.gmv (if mesh.out did not exist, saves to save.out, save.gmv)

test GUI for Solid Constructive Geometry tool in the aniAFT package.  
(for details refer to src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/SCG/README)

# cd ../CAD; cat README
GUI for the OPEN CASCADE: works if the OPEN CASCADE is installed.
Do not forget to set cad environment variables by source command!
You can create a .brep file (input for OPEN CASCADE),
controls for GUI are discussed in src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/CAD/README

      Remove temporary files and libraries
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cd ../../../../../../; make clean
*** Cleaning package (call it from the root of directory ani3D). 
The created libraries will be kept for future use.

# make cleanlibs
*** Uninstalling the package (call it from the root of directory ani3D).
This is equivalent to options 'distclean' or 'purge' used in many other 
packages.
