The six subdirectories contain six examples of adaptive computations 
which demonstrate different features of the package Ani3D:


Interpolation/       is a simple example generating an adaptive mesh to 
                     minimize the maximum error of the P_1 intepolation

AnisotropicBVP/      is an example of solving an elliptic BVP with 
                     anisotropic coefficient using an adaptive 
                     mesh. The domain is the double ramp. 

ConvectionDiffusion/ is an example of solving a convection-diffusion 
                     equation

Elastisity/          is an example of the  adaptive solution of an elastisity problem.

HybridMixedFem/      is an example of adaptive solution of the diffusion equation
                     based on the hybrid mixed finite element discretization 

Stokes/              is an example of solving the Stokes problem using
                     mixed P2-P1 discretization (backward step)

StokesNavier/        is an example of mixed P2-P1 discretization of the
                     Navier-Stokes problem (backward step).
