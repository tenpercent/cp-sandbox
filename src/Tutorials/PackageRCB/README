The program demonstrates the use of local refinement/coarsening library librcb3D.a based
on the Marked Edge Bisection.  It starts from a simple coarse tetrahedral meshes,
(the mesh may be arbitrary conformal)
refines it nlevel times according to the rule given in RefineRule,
and coarse the refined mesh 4 times according to the rule given in CoarseRule.
Examples of RefineRule, CoarseRule are given in main.f.
Prior the refinement/coarsening the routine  InitializeRCB has to be called (once).
The rules are designed so that the mesh refines towards a point source moving along
the edge of the computational polyhedral domain.

Caution! Curve-linear boundary faces are processed as straight:
         no crv data are on input/output.

The program uses  routines [drawGMVmesh] from libview3D.a and [error] from libmba3D.a.

The output  is  three gmv-pictures of the initial mesh (ini.gmv) and the mesh refined towards
the initial position of the source (fst.gmv) and the final position of the source (lst.gmv)


The user must
  1) provide an initial tetrahedrization in main.f
  2) make user routines of rules of refinement/coarsening similar 
     to RefineRule, CoarseRule in main.f

Then the user can:
  3) cd ../../aniRCB; make lib; cd ../Tutorials/PackageRCB   # this creates the library librcb2D.a
  4) make exe   # compiles main.f and produces the executable
  5) make run   # runs the executable
  6) make gmv-ini gmv-fst gmv-lst  # shows gmv-images of the initial mesh as well as
                                   # mesh refined towards the initial position of the source (fst.gmv) 
                                   # and the final position of the source (lst.gmv) 

The mesh is stored the following format:
  nv,nt,nb                        number of nodes, tetrahedra and boundary faces
  ((tet(i,j),i=1,4),j=1,nt)       connectivity table,
   (material(i),i=1,nt)           labels/materials of tetrahedra,
  ((bnd(i,j),i=1,3),j=1,nb)       connectivity table for boundary faces, 
   (labelF(i),i=1,nb)             boundary face labels
  (vrt(3,i),i=1,nv)               coordinates of nodes.
