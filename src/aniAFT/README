AUTHORS

Ani3D-AFT was developed by Alexander Danilov, Kirill Nikitin, Anatoly Vershinin and 
Andrey Plenkin under the supervision of Yuri Vassilevski and Konstantin Lipnikov.
The package is an independent part of the package Ani3D developed by Konstantin 
Lipnikov (lipnikov@gmail.com) and Yuri Vassilevski (yuri.vassilevski@gmail.com).


BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE PACKAGE

In order to describe the libraries, we separate two basic objects: (1) the initial 
front (triangular mesh of the domain boundary with direction of movement) and 
(2) the conformal tetrahedral mesh.

The tetrahedral mesh can be produced by AFT if the initial front is shape regular.
The user is given a number of tools for producing the desirable initial front.

The engine for tetrahedrization is the library libaft3D-$(version).a (source code is in 
src/aniAFT/src/aniTET). It provides two routines:

   - mesh_3d_aft_func_  generates a shape regular tetrahedrization with a local 
                        mesh size controlled by the user defined function fsize;
   - mesh_3d_aft_cf_    generates a shape regular tetrahedrization which is 
                        coarsened towards the domain interior with the geometric 
                        factor cf.

Both routines need an initial front, which may be loaded from a file (read_front, 
write_front for saving front) with extension .frt (e.g., data/knot.frt, 
data/sculpture.frt). An example of using these routines is in file
src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_aft.c

The first tool for the initial front generation is library libfrtprm-$(version).a (the source 
code is in directory src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/PRM). It uses representation of the 
boundary as a union of smooth parameterized patches. Routine 

   set_param_functions(surface_param, v_u_param) 

adopts the user given parameterizations of the patches surface_param() and their 
boundaries v_u_param(). Routine 

   set_surface_size_function(fsize) 

adopts the user given mesh size function fsize(). Routine 

   surface_boundary_ 

produces a shape regular triangulation of the boundary with mesh size controlled by 
fsize(). An example of their use is in file src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_prm.c
Also check src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_prm_flat.c for more info.


The second tool for the initial front generation is library libfrtscg-$(version).a (the source
code is in directory src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/SCG). It uses SCG representation of the 
domain. The domain is the result of logical operations (union, difference, intersection) 
with primitives (sphere, box, etc.). Each primitive is given by its front (oriented 
surface quasi-uniform mesh), and the result is the oriented surface quasi-uniform 
mesh of the domain boundary (initial front). Routine 

   scg_intersect_mesh 

makes the operations with two front on input and one front on output. Routines 

   scg_make_sphere, scg_make_paral, scg_make_cylinder, 
   scg_scale, scg_translate, scg_rotate 

help to define the primitives (by generating their fronts). An example of their use 
is given in file src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_scg.c


The third tool for the initial front generation is library libfrtmdf-$(version).a (the source code
is in directory src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/MDF). It uses representation of the boundary as 
a triangular approximating of the actual boundary with a given accuracy (a CAD mesh). 
The triangles (facets) may be anisotropic or severely distorted. An automated remeshing 
of the CAD mesh such that the mew mesh nodes belong to the CAD surface yields the shape 
regular initial front. Routine 

   check_surface_topology_fix_ 

checks the topology of the input CAD mesh and merges possible duplicate vertices. Routine 

   surface_refine_setup_poly 
   surface_refine_setup_cf 

sets control parameters for routine surface_refine_. Their meaning is described in file
polyreg.cpp. Routine 

   surface_refine_ 

refines (modifies) the CAD mesh and produces the initial front. An example of their use is 
given in file src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_mdf.c
Also check src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_mdf_frt.c for another example.


The fourth tool for the initial front generation is library libfrtcad-$(version).a (the source code is in directory
src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/CAD). It interactes with the public CAD system OPENCASCADE
http://www.opencascade.org/ through the interface library CGM. 
Open CASCADE should be properly installed before the compilation of Ani3D-AFT.
The interface between AFT kernel and CAD system is based on the Common Geometry Module, Argonne (CGMA,
http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/CGM). CGMA is derived from the Common Geometry Module (CGM)
developed at Sandia National Laboratories (http://cubit.sandia.gov/cgm.html)
Ani3D-AFT uses modified version CGMA-10.2.3 with some experimental patches for Ani3D-AFT.
This version is located in src/cgm. It requires at least Open CASCADE version 6.3.

In order to compile CGM and use Open CASCADE support in Ani3D-AFT, environment
variable $CASROOT should be defined. It should point to the path where Open
CASCADE is installed. For CGM installation, it is assumed that the target of $CASROOT is the directory
which includes subdirectories either inc, lib, or ros/inc, ros/lib. If the installed version of Open CASCADE
does not have such a directory or does not define $CASROOT 
(it is the case of installation via package manager in Ubuntu Linux), we recommend to define it as follows:
mkdir opencascade (elsewhere, e.g. in home directory of Ani3D)
mkdir opencascade/ros
ln -s /usr/lib opencascade/ros/lib
ln -s /usr/include/opencascade opencascade/ros/inc
ln -s /usr/share/opencascade/6.3.0/src opencascade/ros/src
export CASROOT=PATH_TO_opencascade/ros or
define CASROOT in .bashrc ("export CASROOT=PATH_TO_opencascade/ros")


If $CASROOT variable is unset, CGM will not be compiled, and Open CASCADE support
will be disabled.
If $CASROOT variable is set, CGM will be compiled, and library libfrtcad-$(version).a (source
code is in src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/CAD) will be built.

An example of library usage is given in src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main_cad.c
Main routines to use with libfrtcad-$(version).a are:

  CGM_Init

initializes the CGM interface.

  CGM_LoadModelFromFile

loads the CAD input data (*.brep) and results in OPENCASCADE object 'model'.

  CGM_LoadOCCModelFromFile

loads the CAD input data using different file formants ("OCC", "STEP", "IGES").

  surface_CGM_model_(model,..)

produces a shape regular triangulation of the boundary of 'model'.


GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE

The package is designed so that no graphical interface is needed for the front or 
tetramesh production. The mesh or front may be saved in files with gmv-format (write_mesh_gmv) 
and then visualized and analyzed by GMV package. However, for user convenience, a graphical 
user interface (GUI) is added for the second tool (src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/SCG). 
Operations with primitives may be visualized using this GUI based on the glut library. 
An example of use of GUI is given in file src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/SCG/gui_glut.cpp.
A description of the control parameters of the GUI is given in src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/SCG/README

If the user installed Open CASCADE library, he may wish to take advantage of CASCADE GUI executable DRAWEXE.
It may be used  to create a .brep file (the input file for Open CASCADE)
A brief description of the control parameters of the GUI is given in src/aniAFT/src/aniFRT/GUI/CAD/README


LEARNING

The best way to learn the package capability is to look through src/Tutorials/PackageAFT/main*.c.
These programs demonstrate the use of the routines (with extensive comments) and data structure.


COMPILATION AND LINKING

The package Ani3D-AFT has been desinged to be independent from the package Ani3D. 
Therefore, is uses its own compiling and linking rules src/aniAFT/src/cflags.make. 

To make all libraries of the package:                    cd src/aniAFT; make lib
To make GUI executable for the second tool:              cd src/aniAFT; make gui
To create all test executables of the package:           cd src/Tutorials/PackageAFT; make exe

All libraries are located in directory ani3D/lib



RUNNING TESTS

All executables are located in directory ani3D/bin

./FrontToTet_aft.exe ../data/knot.frt
gmv -i mesh.gmv

./FrontToTet_aft.exe ../data/sculpture.frt
gmv -i mesh.gmv

Test2: define the boundary through the union of smooth patches (non-flat patches 
are parameterized) and generate a tetrahedral mesh

the boundary of their difference and generate a tetrahedral mesh 

./ScgToTet_aft.exe
gmv -i mesh.gmv

Test5: control and visualize operations with two primitives through GUI (to save 
the front, use w or W; to learn other GUI controls: ./gui_glut.exe):

   to create a 0.3-mesh for sphere with radius 1.6, centered at (0, 0, 1) and
   rotated by angles 0, 0, 0 and a 0.3-mesh for cylinder with radius 0.6, height 5,
   centered at (0, 0, -1) and rotated by angles 0.3, 0 and 0.5

./gui_glut.exe +s 1.6 0 0 1 0 0 0 0.3 +c 0.6 5 0 0 -1 0.3 0 0.5 0.3
